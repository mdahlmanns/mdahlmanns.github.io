However, this behavior poses a risk for the privacy of clients since these services are able to generate profiles containing very sensitive information, e.g., vulnerability information or collaboration partners. Hence, a rising need for protocols that enable clients to obtain knowledge without revealing their requests exists. To address this issue, we propose a protocol that enables clients (i) to query large cloud-based knowledge systems in a privacy-preserving manner using Private Set Intersection and (ii) to subsequently obtain individual knowledge items without leaking the client\u0026rsquo;s requests via few Oblivious Transfers. With our preliminary design, we allow clients to save a significant amount of time in comparison to performing Oblivious Transfers only.","tags":["private query protocol; knowledge system; remote knowledge; private set intersection; oblivious  transfer"],"title":"Privacy-Preserving Remote Knowledge System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jens Hiller","Jan Pennekamp","Markus Dahlmanns","Martin Henze","Andriy Panchenko","Klaus Wehrle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567154704,"objectID":"a63d35a442c475382ba5ee4e0700a24b","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2019-hiller-icnp-tailoring-or/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T09:39:06.914989Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-hiller-icnp-tailoring-or/","section":"publication","summary":"An increasing number of IoT scenarios involve mobile, resource-constrained IoT devices that rely on untrusted networks for Internet connectivity. In such environments, attackers can derive sensitive private information of IoT device owners, e.g., daily routines or secret supply chain procedures, when sniffing on IoT communication and linking IoT devices and owner. Furthermore, untrusted networks do not provide IoT devices with any protection against attacks from the Internet. Anonymous communication using onion routing provides a well-proven mechanism to keep the relationship between communication partners secret and (optionally) protect against network attacks. However, the application of onion routing is challenged by protocol incompatibilities and demanding cryptographic processing on constrained IoT devices, rendering its use infeasible. To close this gap, we tailor onion routing to the IoT by bridging protocol incompatibilities and offloading expensive cryptographic processing to a router or web server of the IoT device owner. Thus, we realize resource-conserving access control and end-to-end security for IoT devices. To prove applicability, we deploy onion routing for the IoT within the well-established Tor network enabling IoT devices to leverage its resources to achieve the same grade of anonymity as readily available to traditional devices.","tags":null,"title":"Tailoring Onion Routing to the Internet of Things: Security and Privacy in Untrusted Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jens Hiller","Karsten Komanns","Markus Dahlmanns","Klaus Wehrle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1568367547,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567154704,"objectID":"1322df30ee4b2a445e03e76dd127ce13","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2019-hiller-aeit-regaining/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T09:39:07.000306Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-hiller-aeit-regaining/","section":"publication","summary":"Smart Grids require extensive communication to enable safe and stable energy supply in the age of decentralized and dynamic energy production and consumption. To protect the communication in this critical infrastructure, public authorities mandate smart meter gateways (SMGWs) to intercept all inbound and outbound communication of premises such as a factory or smart home, and forward the communication data on secure channels established by the SMGW itself to be in control of the communication security. However, using the SMGW as proxy, local devices can neither review the security of these remote connections established by the SMGW nor enforce higher security guarantees than established by the all in one configuration of the SMGW which does not allow for use case-specific security settings. We present mechanisms that enable local devices to regain this insight and control over the full connection, i.e., up to the final receiver, while retaining the SMGW's ability to ensure a suitable security level. Our evaluation shows modest computation and transmission overheads for this increased security in the critical smart grid infrastructure.","tags":null,"title":"Regaining Insight and Control on SMGW-based Secure Communication in Smart Grids","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This page is powered by the Academic Theme for Hugo.
