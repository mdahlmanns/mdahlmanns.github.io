The containerization framework Docker eases the use of this concept and enables sharing images publicly, gaining high momentum. However, it can lead to users creating and sharing images that include private keys or API secrets—either by mistake or out of negligence. This leakage impairs the creator's security and that of everyone using the image. Yet, the extent of this practice and how to counteract it remains unclear.  In this paper, we analyze 337,171 images from Docker Hub and 8,076 other private registries unveiling that 8.5% of images indeed include secrets. Specifically, we find 52,107 private keys and 3,158 leaked API secrets, both opening a large attack surface, i.e., putting authentication and confidentiality of privacy-sensitive data at stake and even allow active attacks. We further document that those leaked keys are used in the wild: While we discovered 1,060 certificates relying on compromised keys being issued by public certificate authorities, based on further active Internet measurements, we find 275,269 TLS and SSH hosts using leaked private keys for authentication. To counteract this issue, we discuss how our methodology can be used to prevent secret leakage and reuse.","tags":["network security","security configuration","secret leakage","container"],"title":"Secrets Revealed in Container Images: An Internet-wide Study on Occurrence and Impact","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Pennekamp","Anastasiia Belova","Thomas Bergs","Matthias Bodenbenner","Andreas Bührig-Polaczek","Markus Dahlmanns","Ike Kunze","Moritz Kröger","Sandra Geisler","Martin Henze","Daniel Lütticke","Benjamin Montavon","Philipp Niemietz","Lucia Ortjohann","Maximilian Rudack","Robert H.

Consequently, it requires a technical infrastructure that can support the agile deployment of these concepts and corresponding high-level applications, which, e.g., demand the processing of massive data in motion and at rest. As such, key research aspects are the support for low-latency control loops, concepts on scalable data stream processing, deployable information security, and semantically rich and efficient long-term storage. In particular, such an infrastructure cannot continue to be limited to machines and sensors, but additionally needs to encompass networked environments: production cells, edge computing, and location-independent cloud infrastructures. Finally, in light of the envisioned WWL, i.e., the interconnection of production sites, the technical infrastructure must be advanced to support secure and privacy-preserving industrial collaboration. To evolve today’s production sites and lay the infrastructural foundation for the IoP, we identify five broad streams of research: (1) adapting data and stream processing to heterogeneous data from distributed sources, (2) ensuring data interoperability between systems and production sites, (3) exchanging and sharing data with different stakeholders, (4) network security approaches addressing the risks of increasing interconnectivity, and (5) security architectures to enable secure and privacy-preserving industrial collaboration. With our research, we evolve the underlying infrastructure from isolated, sparsely networked production sites toward an architecture that supports high-level applications and sophisticated digital shadows while facilitating the transition toward a WWL.","tags":["Cyber-physical production systems","Data streams","Industrial data processing","Industrial network security","Industrial data security","Secure industrial collaboration"],"title":"Evolving the Digital Industrial Infrastructure for Production: Steps Taken and the Road Ahead","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tobias Lorz","Johann Jaeger","Antigona Selimaj","Immanuel Hacker","Andreas Ulbig","Jan-Peter Heckel","Christian Becker","Markus Dahlmanns","Ina Berenice Fink","Klaus Wehrle","Gerrit Erichsen","Michael Schindler","Rainer Luxenburger","Guosong Lin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1695978565,"objectID":"88a32b9f90c2f870c3adcf26f3fc45ae","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2023-lorz-cired/","publishdate":"2023-09-29T09:09:13.320612Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-lorz-cired/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Interconnected Grid Protection Systems - Reference Grid For Testing An Adaptive Protection Scheme","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Pennekamp","Markus Dahlmanns","Frederik Fuhrmann","Timo Heutmann","Alexander Kreppein","Dennis Grunert","Christoph Lange","Robert H.

Today, buyers and sellers must disclose sensitive information on products upfront before the actual manufacturing. However, without a trust relation, this situation is precarious for the involved companies as they fear for their competitiveness. Related work overlooks this issue so far: Existing approaches only protect the information of a single party only, hindering dynamic and on-demand business relationships. To account for the corresponding research gap of inadequately privacy-protected information and to deal with companies without an established trust relation, we pursue the direction of innovative privacy-preserving purchase inquiries that seamlessly integrate into today's established supplier management and procurement processes. Utilizing well-established building blocks from private computing, such as private set intersection and homomorphic encryption, we propose two designs with slightly different privacy and performance implications to securely realize purchase inquiries over the Internet. In particular, we allow buyers to consider more potential sellers without sharing sensitive information and relieve sellers of the burden of repeatedly preparing elaborate yet discarded offers. We demonstrate our approaches' scalability using two real-world use cases from the domain of production technology. Overall, we present deployable designs that offer two-way privacy for purchase inquiries and, in turn, fill a gap that currently hinders establishing dynamic and flexible business relationships. In the future, we expect significantly increasing research activity in this overlooked area to address the needs of an evolving production landscape.","tags":["bootstrapping procurement","secure industrial collaboration","private set intersection","homomorphic encryption","Internet of Production"],"title":"Offering Two-Way Privacy for Evolved Purchase Inquiries","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1653978600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688118360,"objectID":"7832a4071c6ffb1f76f21865e07e9360","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/missed-opportunities-measuring-the-untapped-tls-support-in-the-industrial-internet-of-things/","publishdate":"2022-07-03T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/missed-opportunities-measuring-the-untapped-tls-support-in-the-industrial-internet-of-things/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Missed Opportunities: Measuring the Untapped TLS Support in the Industrial Internet of Things","type":"event"},{"authors":["Dominik Kus","Eric Wagner","Jan Pennekamp","Konrad Wolsing","Ina Berenice Fink","Markus Dahlmanns","Klaus Wehrle","Martin Henze"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1651363200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1695978565,"objectID":"548a76173785993d52ed1c1e2369c9e2","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2022-kus-iids-generalizability/","publishdate":"2023-09-29T09:09:13.380977Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-kus-iids-generalizability/","section":"publication","summary":"Anomaly-based intrusion detection promises to detect novel or unknown attacks on industrial control systems by modeling expected system behavior and raising corresponding alarms for any deviations. As manually creating these behavioral models is tedious and error-prone, research focuses on machine learning to train them automatically, achieving detection rates upwards of 99 %. However, these approaches are typically trained not only on benign traffic but also on attacks and then evaluated against the same type of attack used for training. Hence, their actual, real-world performance on unknown (not trained on) attacks remains unclear. In turn, the reported near-perfect detection rates of machine learning-based intrusion detection might create a false sense of security. To assess this situation and clarify the real potential of machine learning-based industrial intrusion detection, we develop an evaluation methodology and examine multiple approaches from literature for their performance on unknown attacks (excluded from training). Our results highlight an ineffectiveness in detecting unknown attacks, with detection rates dropping to between 3.2 % and 14.7 % for some types of attacks. Moving forward, we derive recommendations for further research on machine learning-based approaches to ensure clarity on their ability to detect unknown attacks.","tags":["anomaly detection","machine learning","industrial control system"],"title":"A False Sense of Security?

Consequently, to ensure end-to-end secure communication and authentication, (i) traditional industrial protocols, e.g., Modbus, are retrofitted with TLS support, and (ii) modern protocols, e.g., MQTT, are directly designed to use TLS. To understand whether these changes indeed lead to secure Industrial Internet of Things deployments, i.e., using TLS-based protocols, which are configured according to security best practices, we perform an Internet-wide security assessment of ten industrial protocols covering the complete IPv4 address space. Our results show that both, retrofitted existing protocols and newly developed secure alternatives, are barely noticeable in the wild. While we find that new protocols have a higher TLS adoption rate than traditional protocols (7.2 % vs. 0.4 %), the overall adoption of TLS is comparably low (6.5 % of hosts). Thus, most industrial deployments (934,736 hosts) are insecurely connected to the Internet. Furthermore, we identify that 42 % of hosts with TLS support (26,665 hosts) show security deficits, e.g., missing access control.

However, today’s static grid protection cannot manage all upcoming conditions while providing a high level of dependability and security. It forms a bottleneck of a future decarbonizing grid development.   In our research project, we develop and verify an adaptive grid protection algorithm. It calculates situation dependent protection parameters for the event of power flow shifts and topology changes caused by volatile power supplies due to the increase of renewable generation and the rapid expansion of e-mobility. As a result the distribution grid can be operated with the optimally adapted protection parameters and functions for changing operating states. To safely adjust the values on protection hardware in the field, i.e., safe from hardware failures and cyberattacks, we research resilient and secure communication concepts for the adaptive and interconnected grid protection system. Finally, we validate our concept and system by demonstrations in the laboratory and field tests.","tags":null,"title":"Interconnected network protection systems - the basis for the reliable and safe operation of distribution grids with a high penetration of renewable energies and electric vehicle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Pennekamp","Erik Buchholz","Markus Dahlmanns","Ike Kunze","Stefan Braun","Eric Wagner","Matthias Brockmann","Klaus Wehrle","Martin Henze"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1695978565,"objectID":"ee28f15b87c91fb583d1d66a7670552c","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2021-pennekamp-laser/","publishdate":"2023-09-29T09:09:13.452228Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-pennekamp-laser/","section":"publication","summary":"Following the recent Internet of Things-induced trends on digitization in general, industrial applications will further evolve as well. With a focus on the domains of manufacturing and production, the Internet of Production pursues the vision of a digitized, globally interconnected, yet secure environment by establishing a distributed knowledge base. Background. As part of our collaborative research of advancing the scope of industrial applications through cybersecurity and privacy, we identified a set of common challenges and pitfalls that surface in such applied interdisciplinary collaborations. Aim. Our goal with this paper is to support researchers in the emerging field of cybersecurity in industrial settings by formalizing our experiences as reference for other research efforts, in industry and academia alike. Method. Based on our experience, we derived a process cycle of performing such interdisciplinary research, from the initial idea to the eventual dissemination and paper writing. This presented methodology strives to successfully bootstrap further research and to encourage further work in this emerging area. Results. Apart from our newly proposed process cycle, we report on our experiences and conduct a case study applying this methodology, raising awareness for challenges in cybersecurity research for industrial applications. We further detail the interplay between our process cycle and the data lifecycle in applied research data management. Finally, we augment our discussion with an industrial as well as an academic view on this research area and highlight that both areas still have to overcome significant challenges to sustainably and securely advance industrial applications. Conclusions. With our proposed process cycle for interdisciplinary research in the intersection of cybersecurity and industrial application, we provide a foundation for further research.

To address this issue, the concepts of confidential computing and cloud computing come to mind as they promise to offer scalable approaches that preserve the privacy of participating companies. In particular, designs building on confidential computing can help to technically enforce privacy. Moreover, cloud computing constitutes an elegant design choice to scale these novel protocols to industry needs while limiting the setup and management overhead for practitioners.

Moving from traditional one-to-one to many-to-many communication, publish/subscribe systems promise a more dynamic and efficient exchange of data. However, the resulting significantly more complex communication relationships render traditional end-to-end security futile for sufficiently protecting the sensitive and safety-critical data transmitted in industrial systems. Most notably, the central message brokers inherent in publish/subscribe systems introduce a designated weak spot for security as they can access all communication messages. To address this issue, we propose ENTRUST, a novel solution for key server-based end-to-end security in publish/subscribe systems. ENTRUST transparently realizes confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for publish/subscribe systems without any modification of the underlying protocol. We exemplarily implement ENTRUST on top of MQTT, the de-facto standard for machine-to-machine communication, showing that ENTRUST can integrate seamlessly into existing publish/subscribe systems.","tags":["cyber-physical system security","publish-subscribe security","end-to-end security"],"title":"Transparent End-to-End Security for Publish/Subscribe Communication in Cyber-Physical Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1616756100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635711019,"objectID":"8203381a36b28d012dbca3ba5d446ad6","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/easing-the-conscience-with-opc-ua-an-internet-wide-study-on-insecure-deployments/","publishdate":"2020-11-09T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/easing-the-conscience-with-opc-ua-an-internet-wide-study-on-insecure-deployments/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Easing the Conscience with OPC UA: An Internet-Wide Study on Insecure Deployments","type":"event"},{"authors":["admin","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Therefore, companies hesitate to offer their production data, e.g., process parameters that would allow other companies to establish new production lines faster, against a quid pro quo. Nevertheless, the expected benefits of industrial collaboration, data exchanges, and the utilization of external knowledge are significant. In this paper, we introduce our Bloom filter-based Parameter Exchange (BPE), which enables companies to exchange process parameters privacy-preservingly. We demonstrate the applicability of our platform based on two distinct real-world use cases: injection molding and machine tools. We show that BPE is both scalable and deployable for different needs to foster industrial collaborations. Thereby, we reward data-providing companies with payments while preserving their valuable data and reducing the risks of data leakage.","tags":["secure industrial collaboration","Bloom filter","oblivious transfer","Internet of Production"],"title":"Privacy-Preserving Production Process Parameter Exchange","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604647800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635711019,"objectID":"dacce908e65e236a53b7b5c218197bb3","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/easing-the-conscience-with-opc-ua-an-internet-wide-study-on-insecure-deployments/","publishdate":"2020-11-09T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/easing-the-conscience-with-opc-ua-an-internet-wide-study-on-insecure-deployments/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Easing the Conscience with OPC UA: An Internet-Wide Study on Insecure Deployments","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603830600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635711019,"objectID":"b553f29395e55ee9d5c8aa62cc1b9ae4","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/easing-the-conscience-with-opc-ua-an-internet-wide-study-on-insecure-deployments/","publishdate":"2020-11-09T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/easing-the-conscience-with-opc-ua-an-internet-wide-study-on-insecure-deployments/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Easing the Conscience with OPC UA: An Internet-Wide Study on Insecure Deployments","type":"event"},{"authors":["Markus Dahlmanns","Johannes Lohmöller","Ina Berenice Fink","Jan Pennekamp","Klaus Wehrle","Martin Henze"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1695978565,"objectID":"10d31fe3b31af39411545aa0d54ac9af","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2020-dahlmanns-imc-opcua/","publishdate":"2023-09-29T09:09:13.670954Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-dahlmanns-imc-opcua/","section":"publication","summary":"Due to increasing digitalization, formerly isolated industrial networks, e.g., for factory and process automation, move closer and closer to the Internet, mandating secure communication.

To study whether Internet-facing OPC UA appliances are configured securely, we actively scan the IPv4 address space for publicly reachable OPC UA systems and assess the security of their configurations. We observe problematic security configurations such as missing access control (on 24% of hosts), disabled security functionality (24%), or use of deprecated cryptographic primitives (25%) on in total 92% of the reachable deployments. Furthermore, we discover several hundred devices in multiple autonomous systems sharing the same security certificate, opening the door for impersonation attacks.

In such environments, attackers can derive sensitive private information of IoT device owners, e.g., daily routines or secret supply chain procedures, when sniffing on IoT communication and linking IoT devices and owner. Furthermore, untrusted networks do not provide IoT devices with any protection against attacks from the Internet. Anonymous communication using onion routing provides a well-proven mechanism to keep the relationship between communication partners secret and (optionally) protect against network attacks. However, the application of onion routing is challenged by protocol incompatibilities and demanding cryptographic processing on constrained IoT devices, rendering its use infeasible. To close this gap, we tailor onion routing to the IoT by bridging protocol incompatibilities and offloading expensive cryptographic processing to a router or web server of the IoT device owner. Thus, we realize resource-conserving access control and end-to-end security for IoT devices. To prove applicability, we deploy onion routing for the IoT within the well-established Tor network enabling IoT devices to leverage its resources to achieve the same grade of anonymity as readily available to traditional devices.","tags":null,"title":"Tailoring Onion Routing to the Internet of Things: Security and Privacy in Untrusted Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1568886300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635711019,"objectID":"6e8fc9b248f7b010f82d88f9de15c124","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/regaining-insight-and-control-on-smgw-based-secure-communication-in-smart-grids/","publishdate":"2020-11-09T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/regaining-insight-and-control-on-smgw-based-secure-communication-in-smart-grids/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Regaining Insight and Control on SMGW-based Secure Communication in Smart Grids","type":"event"},{"authors":["Jens Hiller","Karsten Komanns","Markus Dahlmanns","Klaus Wehrle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1695978565,"objectID":"1322df30ee4b2a445e03e76dd127ce13","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2019-hiller-aeit-regaining/","publishdate":"2023-09-29T09:09:13.929752Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-hiller-aeit-regaining/","section":"publication","summary":"Smart Grids require extensive communication to enable safe and stable energy supply in the age of decentralized and dynamic energy production and consumption.

However, using the SMGW as proxy, local devices can neither review the security of these remote connections established by the SMGW nor enforce higher security guarantees than established by the all in one configuration of the SMGW which does not allow for use case-specific security settings. We present mechanisms that enable local devices to regain this insight and control over the full connection, i.e., up to the final receiver, while retaining the SMGW's ability to ensure a suitable security level.

You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
