For the Web, Let’s Encrypt offers a usable foundation to safeguard such data by straightforwardly issuing certificates. However, its approach is not directly applicable to the IoT as deployments lack a (dedicated) domain or miss essentials to prove domain ownership required for Let’s Encrypt. Thus, a usable approach to secure IoT deployments by properly authenticating IoT devices is missing. To close this research gap, we propose LUA-IoT, our framework to Let’s Usably Authenticate the IoT. LUA-IoT enables autonomous certificate enrollment by orienting at the success story of Let’s Encrypt, seamlessly integrating in the setup process of modern IoT devices, and relying on process steps that users already know from other domains. In the end, LUA-IoT binds the authenticity of IoT deployments to a globally valid user identifier, e.g., an email address, that is included in certificates directly issued to the IoT deployments. We exemplarily implement LUA-IoT to show that it is realizable on commodity IoT hardware and conduct a small user study indicating that LUA-IoT indeed nudges users to safeguard their devices and data (transmissions).","tags":null,"title":"LUA-IoT: Let's Usably Authenticate the IoT","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ina Berenice Fink","Markus Dahlmanns","Gerrit Erichsen","Klaus Wehrle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1730419200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1734517357,"objectID":"aed852cf3cc4591573431f7790bb7955","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2024-fink-cired/","publishdate":"2024-12-18T10:20:20.758206Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2024-fink-cired/","section":"publication","summary":"Resilient communication is essential for reliably exchanging parameters and measurements in distribution systems.

Many of these measures involve sophisticated communication between the control center and the stations that is not efficiently realizable using traditional protocols, e.g., IEC 60870-5-104. To this end, IEC 61850 introduces data models which allow flexible communication. Still, the specification leaves open how DSOs should interconnect their stations to realize resilient communication between the control center and station devices. However, DSOs require such communication to adapt modern solutions increasing the grid's capacity, e.g., adaptive protection systems.  In this paper, we present our envisioned network and communication concept for future DSO's ICT infrastructures that enables the control center to resiliently and flexibly communicate with station devices. For resilience, we suggest interconnecting each station with two distinct communication paths to the control center, use MPLS-TP and MPTCP for fast failovers when a single link fails, and mTLS to protect the communication possibilities against misuse. Additionally, in accordance with IEC 61850, we envision the control center to communicate with the station devices using MMS by using the station RTU as a proxy.","tags":null,"title":"Reliable and Secure Control Center to Station Device Communication","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1715299200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718621632,"objectID":"bb3bfc5a55bb3bfce1beb9105739c761","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/unconsidered-installations-discovering-iot-deployments-in-the-ipv6-internet/","publishdate":"2022-07-03T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/unconsidered-installations-discovering-iot-deployments-in-the-ipv6-internet/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Unconsidered Installations: Discovering IoT Deployments in the IPv6 Internet","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1715212800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718621632,"objectID":"6fe13e82d0f61ac6bdde97bc47d14673","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/protocol-security-in-the-industrial-internet-of-things/","publishdate":"2022-07-03T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/protocol-security-in-the-industrial-internet-of-things/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Protocol Security in the Industrial Internet of Things","type":"event"},{"authors":["Markus Dahlmanns","Klaus Wehrle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1714521600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1734517357,"objectID":"37e273741b2edb25401f7ae9abe2eac9","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2024-dahlmanns-doctoralsym/","publishdate":"2024-12-18T10:20:20.772461Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2024-dahlmanns-doctoralsym/","section":"publication","summary":"Advances like Industry 4.0 lead to a rising number of Internet-connected industrial deployments and thus an Industrial Internet of Things with growing attack vectors.

However, while IoT devices often use IPv6, past studies resorted to comprehensively scan the IPv4 address space. To fully understand how the IoT and all its services and devices is operated, including IPv6-reachable deployments is inevitable-although scanning the entire IPv6 address space is infeasible. In this paper, we close this gap and examine how to best discover IPv6-reachable IoT deployments. To this end, we propose a methodology that allows combining various IPv6 scan direction approaches to understand the findability and prevalence of IPv6-reachable IoT deployments. Using three sources of active IPv6 addresses and eleven address generators, we discovered 6658 IoT deployments. We derive that the available address sources are a good starting point for finding IoT deployments. Additionally, we show that using two address generators is sufficient to cover most found deployments and save time as well as resources. Assessing the security of the deployments, we surprisingly find similar issues as in the IPv4 Internet, although IPv6 deployments might be newer and generally more up-to-date: Only 39% of deployments have access control in place and only 6.2% make use of TLS inviting attackers, e.g., to eavesdrop sensitive data.","tags":["Internet of Things","security","Internet measurements","IPv6","address generators"],"title":"Unconsidered Installations: Discovering IoT Deployments in the IPv6 Internet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Markus Dahlmanns","Roman Matzutt","Chris Dax","Klaus Wehrle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1734517357,"objectID":"9068562a353ea4f665026441d5e12ec9","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2024-dahlmanns-fps/","publishdate":"2024-12-18T10:20:20.782996Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2024-dahlmanns-fps/","section":"publication","summary":"Security configurations remain challenging for trained administrators.

Today, buyers and sellers must disclose sensitive information on products upfront before the actual manufacturing. However, without a trust relation, this situation is precarious for the involved companies as they fear for their competitiveness. Related work overlooks this issue so far: Existing approaches only protect the information of a single party only, hindering dynamic and on-demand business relationships. To account for the corresponding research gap of inadequately privacy-protected information and to deal with companies without an established trust relation, we pursue the direction of innovative privacy-preserving purchase inquiries that seamlessly integrate into today's established supplier management and procurement processes. Utilizing well-established building blocks from private computing, such as private set intersection and homomorphic encryption, we propose two designs with slightly different privacy and performance implications to securely realize purchase inquiries over the Internet. In particular, we allow buyers to consider more potential sellers without sharing sensitive information and relieve sellers of the burden of repeatedly preparing elaborate yet discarded offers. We demonstrate our approaches' scalability using two real-world use cases from the domain of production technology. Overall, we present deployable designs that offer two-way privacy for purchase inquiries and, in turn, fill a gap that currently hinders establishing dynamic and flexible business relationships. In the future, we expect significantly increasing research activity in this overlooked area to address the needs of an evolving production landscape.","tags":["bootstrapping procurement","secure industrial collaboration","private set intersection","homomorphic encryption","Internet of Production"],"title":"Offering Two-Way Privacy for Evolved Purchase Inquiries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Johannes Lohmöller","Eduard Vlad","Markus Dahlmanns","Klaus Wehrle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1698796800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1734517357,"objectID":"4f911fbfd815e13c300f2036bb99a2f6","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2023-lohmoeller-transparency/","publishdate":"2024-12-18T10:20:20.783552Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-lohmoeller-transparency/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["data usage control","data ecosystems","transparency logs"],"title":"Poster: Bridging Trust Gaps: Data Usage Transparency in Federated Data Ecosystems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1689306000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688118360,"objectID":"28572a9d44d262e1d7cf5155bd1d436f","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/secrets-revealed-in-container-images-an-internet-wide-study-on-occurrence-and-impact/","publishdate":"2022-07-03T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/secrets-revealed-in-container-images-an-internet-wide-study-on-occurrence-and-impact/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Secrets Revealed in Container Images: An Internet-wide Study on Occurrence and Impact","type":"event"},{"authors":["Markus Dahlmanns","Constantin Sander","Robin Decker","Klaus Wehrle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1688169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1734517357,"objectID":"7493f3a51108ea3e9fc484a8deb1379f","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2023-dahlmanns-docker/","publishdate":"2024-12-18T10:20:20.818054Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-dahlmanns-docker/","section":"publication","summary":"Containerization allows bundling applications and their dependencies into a single image.

Consequently, it requires a technical infrastructure that can support the agile deployment of these concepts and corresponding high-level applications, which, e.g., demand the processing of massive data in motion and at rest. As such, key research aspects are the support for low-latency control loops, concepts on scalable data stream processing, deployable information security, and semantically rich and efficient long-term storage. In particular, such an infrastructure cannot continue to be limited to machines and sensors, but additionally needs to encompass networked environments: production cells, edge computing, and location-independent cloud infrastructures. Finally, in light of the envisioned WWL, i.e., the interconnection of production sites, the technical infrastructure must be advanced to support secure and privacy-preserving industrial collaboration. To evolve today’s production sites and lay the infrastructural foundation for the IoP, we identify five broad streams of research: (1) adapting data and stream processing to heterogeneous data from distributed sources, (2) ensuring data interoperability between systems and production sites, (3) exchanging and sharing data with different stakeholders, (4) network security approaches addressing the risks of increasing interconnectivity, and (5) security architectures to enable secure and privacy-preserving industrial collaboration. With our research, we evolve the underlying infrastructure from isolated, sparsely networked production sites toward an architecture that supports high-level applications and sophisticated digital shadows while facilitating the transition toward a WWL.","tags":["Cyber-physical production systems","Data streams","Industrial data processing","Industrial network security","Industrial data security","Secure industrial collaboration"],"title":"Evolving the Digital Industrial Infrastructure for Production: Steps Taken and the Road Ahead","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tobias Lorz","Johann Jaeger","Antigona Selimaj","Immanuel Hacker","Andreas Ulbig","Jan-Peter Heckel","Christian Becker","Markus Dahlmanns","Ina Berenice Fink","Klaus Wehrle","Gerrit Erichsen","Michael Schindler","Rainer Luxenburger","Guosong Lin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1734517357,"objectID":"88a32b9f90c2f870c3adcf26f3fc45ae","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2023-lorz-cired/","publishdate":"2024-12-18T10:20:20.86349Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-lorz-cired/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Interconnected grid protection systems - reference grid for testing an adaptive protection scheme","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1653978600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688118360,"objectID":"7832a4071c6ffb1f76f21865e07e9360","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/missed-opportunities-measuring-the-untapped-tls-support-in-the-industrial-internet-of-things/","publishdate":"2022-07-03T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/missed-opportunities-measuring-the-untapped-tls-support-in-the-industrial-internet-of-things/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Missed Opportunities: Measuring the Untapped TLS Support in the Industrial Internet of Things","type":"event"},{"authors":["Dominik Kus","Eric Wagner","Jan Pennekamp","Konrad Wolsing","Ina Berenice Fink","Markus Dahlmanns","Klaus Wehrle","Martin Henze"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1651363200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1734517357,"objectID":"548a76173785993d52ed1c1e2369c9e2","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2022-kus-iids-generalizability/","publishdate":"2024-12-18T10:20:20.883437Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-kus-iids-generalizability/","section":"publication","summary":"Anomaly-based intrusion detection promises to detect novel or unknown attacks on industrial control systems by modeling expected system behavior and raising corresponding alarms for any deviations. As manually creating these behavioral models is tedious and error-prone, research focuses on machine learning to train them automatically, achieving detection rates upwards of 99 %. However, these approaches are typically trained not only on benign traffic but also on attacks and then evaluated against the same type of attack used for training. Hence, their actual, real-world performance on unknown (not trained on) attacks remains unclear. In turn, the reported near-perfect detection rates of machine learning-based intrusion detection might create a false sense of security. To assess this situation and clarify the real potential of machine learning-based industrial intrusion detection, we develop an evaluation methodology and examine multiple approaches from literature for their performance on unknown attacks (excluded from training).

Consequently, to ensure end-to-end secure communication and authentication, (i) traditional industrial protocols, e.g., Modbus, are retrofitted with TLS support, and (ii) modern protocols, e.g., MQTT, are directly designed to use TLS. To understand whether these changes indeed lead to secure Industrial Internet of Things deployments, i.e., using TLS-based protocols, which are configured according to security best practices, we perform an Internet-wide security assessment of ten industrial protocols covering the complete IPv4 address space. Our results show that both, retrofitted existing protocols and newly developed secure alternatives, are barely noticeable in the wild. While we find that new protocols have a higher TLS adoption rate than traditional protocols (7.2 % vs. 0.4 %), the overall adoption of TLS is comparably low (6.5 % of hosts). Thus, most industrial deployments (934,736 hosts) are insecurely connected to the Internet. Furthermore, we identify that 42 % of hosts with TLS support (26,665 hosts) show security deficits, e.g., missing access control. Finally, we show that support in configuring systems securely, e.g., via configuration templates, is promising to strengthen security.","tags":["industrial communication","network security","security configuration"],"title":"Missed Opportunities: Measuring the Untapped TLS Support in the Industrial Internet of Things","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carl-Heinz Genzel","Markus Dahlmanns"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1648115700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648115700,"objectID":"5895e59ab00b3db79219cad4195f9c61","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/low-latency-reliable-and-secure-communication-for-energy-grid-operations/","publishdate":"2020-11-09T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/low-latency-reliable-and-secure-communication-for-energy-grid-operations/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Low Latency, Reliable, and Secure Communication for Energy Grid Operations","type":"event"},{"authors":["Matthias Lorenz","Tobias Markus Pletzer","Malte Schuhmacher","Torsten Sowa","Michael Dahms","Simon Stock","Davood Babazadeh","Christian Becker","Johann Jaeger","Tobias Lorz","Markus Dahlmanns","Ina Berenice Fink","Klaus Wehrle","Andreas Ulbig","Philipp Linnartz","Antigona Selimaj","Thomas Offergeld"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1734517357,"objectID":"bd8907bb5f674b792dabd41408b9fc47","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2022-lorenz-ven-2-us/","publishdate":"2024-12-18T10:20:20.918049Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-lorenz-ven-2-us/","section":"publication","summary":"Power grids are increasingly faced with the introduction of decentralized, highly volatile power supplies from renewable energies and high loads occurring from e-mobility. However, today’s static grid protection cannot manage all upcoming conditions while providing a high level of dependability and security. It forms a bottleneck of a future decarbonizing grid development.   In our research project, we develop and verify an adaptive grid protection algorithm. It calculates situation dependent protection parameters for the event of power flow shifts and topology changes caused by volatile power supplies due to the increase of renewable generation and the rapid expansion of e-mobility. As a result the distribution grid can be operated with the optimally adapted protection parameters and functions for changing operating states. To safely adjust the values on protection hardware in the field, i.e., safe from hardware failures and cyberattacks, we research resilient and secure communication concepts for the adaptive and interconnected grid protection system.

With a focus on the domains of manufacturing and production, the Internet of Production pursues the vision of a digitized, globally interconnected, yet secure environment by establishing a distributed knowledge base. Background. As part of our collaborative research of advancing the scope of industrial applications through cybersecurity and privacy, we identified a set of common challenges and pitfalls that surface in such applied interdisciplinary collaborations. Aim. Our goal with this paper is to support researchers in the emerging field of cybersecurity in industrial settings by formalizing our experiences as reference for other research efforts, in industry and academia alike.

To address this issue, the concepts of confidential computing and cloud computing come to mind as they promise to offer scalable approaches that preserve the privacy of participating companies. In particular, designs building on confidential computing can help to technically enforce privacy.

Moving from traditional one-to-one to many-to-many communication, publish/subscribe systems promise a more dynamic and efficient exchange of data. However, the resulting significantly more complex communication relationships render traditional end-to-end security futile for sufficiently protecting the sensitive and safety-critical data transmitted in industrial systems. Most notably, the central message brokers inherent in publish/subscribe systems introduce a designated weak spot for security as they can access all communication messages. To address this issue, we propose ENTRUST, a novel solution for key server-based end-to-end security in publish/subscribe systems. ENTRUST transparently realizes confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for publish/subscribe systems without any modification of the underlying protocol. We exemplarily implement ENTRUST on top of MQTT, the de-facto standard for machine-to-machine communication, showing that ENTRUST can integrate seamlessly into existing publish/subscribe systems.","tags":["cyber-physical system security","publish-subscribe security","end-to-end security"],"title":"Transparent End-to-End Security for Publish/Subscribe Communication in Cyber-Physical Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1616756100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635711019,"objectID":"8203381a36b28d012dbca3ba5d446ad6","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/easing-the-conscience-with-opc-ua-an-internet-wide-study-on-insecure-deployments/","publishdate":"2020-11-09T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/easing-the-conscience-with-opc-ua-an-internet-wide-study-on-insecure-deployments/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Easing the Conscience with OPC UA: An Internet-Wide Study on Insecure Deployments","type":"event"},{"authors":["admin","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Therefore, companies hesitate to offer their production data, e.g., process parameters that would allow other companies to establish new production lines faster, against a quid pro quo. Nevertheless, the expected benefits of industrial collaboration, data exchanges, and the utilization of external knowledge are significant. In this paper, we introduce our Bloom filter-based Parameter Exchange (BPE), which enables companies to exchange process parameters privacy-preservingly. We demonstrate the applicability of our platform based on two distinct real-world use cases: injection molding and machine tools. We show that BPE is both scalable and deployable for different needs to foster industrial collaborations. Thereby, we reward data-providing companies with payments while preserving their valuable data and reducing the risks of data leakage.","tags":["secure industrial collaboration","Bloom filter","oblivious transfer","Internet of Production"],"title":"Privacy-Preserving Production Process Parameter Exchange","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604647800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635711019,"objectID":"dacce908e65e236a53b7b5c218197bb3","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/easing-the-conscience-with-opc-ua-an-internet-wide-study-on-insecure-deployments/","publishdate":"2020-11-09T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/easing-the-conscience-with-opc-ua-an-internet-wide-study-on-insecure-deployments/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Easing the Conscience with OPC UA: An Internet-Wide Study on Insecure Deployments","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603830600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635711019,"objectID":"b553f29395e55ee9d5c8aa62cc1b9ae4","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/easing-the-conscience-with-opc-ua-an-internet-wide-study-on-insecure-deployments/","publishdate":"2020-11-09T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/easing-the-conscience-with-opc-ua-an-internet-wide-study-on-insecure-deployments/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Easing the Conscience with OPC UA: An Internet-Wide Study on Insecure Deployments","type":"event"},{"authors":["Markus Dahlmanns","Johannes Lohmöller","Ina Berenice Fink","Jan Pennekamp","Klaus Wehrle","Martin Henze"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1734517357,"objectID":"10d31fe3b31af39411545aa0d54ac9af","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2020-dahlmanns-imc-opcua/","publishdate":"2024-12-18T10:20:20.985681Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-dahlmanns-imc-opcua/","section":"publication","summary":"Due to increasing digitalization, formerly isolated industrial networks, e.g., for factory and process automation, move closer and closer to the Internet, mandating secure communication.

To study whether Internet-facing OPC UA appliances are configured securely, we actively scan the IPv4 address space for publicly reachable OPC UA systems and assess the security of their configurations. We observe problematic security configurations such as missing access control (on 24% of hosts), disabled security functionality (24%), or use of deprecated cryptographic primitives (25%) on in total 92% of the reachable deployments. Furthermore, we discover several hundred devices in multiple autonomous systems sharing the same security certificate, opening the door for impersonation attacks.

Furthermore, untrusted networks do not provide IoT devices with any protection against attacks from the Internet. Anonymous communication using onion routing provides a well-proven mechanism to keep the relationship between communication partners secret and (optionally) protect against network attacks. However, the application of onion routing is challenged by protocol incompatibilities and demanding cryptographic processing on constrained IoT devices, rendering its use infeasible. To close this gap, we tailor onion routing to the IoT by bridging protocol incompatibilities and offloading expensive cryptographic processing to a router or web server of the IoT device owner. Thus, we realize resource-conserving access control and end-to-end security for IoT devices. To prove applicability, we deploy onion routing for the IoT within the well-established Tor network enabling IoT devices to leverage its resources to achieve the same grade of anonymity as readily available to traditional devices.","tags":null,"title":"Tailoring Onion Routing to the Internet of Things: Security and Privacy in Untrusted Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1568886300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635711019,"objectID":"6e8fc9b248f7b010f82d88f9de15c124","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/regaining-insight-and-control-on-smgw-based-secure-communication-in-smart-grids/","publishdate":"2020-11-09T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/regaining-insight-and-control-on-smgw-based-secure-communication-in-smart-grids/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Regaining Insight and Control on SMGW-based Secure Communication in Smart Grids","type":"event"},{"authors":["Jens Hiller","Karsten Komanns","Markus Dahlmanns","Klaus Wehrle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1734517357,"objectID":"1322df30ee4b2a445e03e76dd127ce13","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2019-hiller-aeit-regaining/","publishdate":"2024-12-18T10:20:21.068964Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-hiller-aeit-regaining/","section":"publication","summary":"Smart Grids require extensive communication to enable safe and stable energy supply in the age of decentralized and dynamic energy production and consumption.

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you’ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - blox-plugins-netlify - blox-plugins-netlify-cms - blox-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - blox-plugins-netlify - blox-plugins-netlify-cms - blox-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
