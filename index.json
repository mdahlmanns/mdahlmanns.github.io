Consequently, to ensure end-to-end secure communication and authentication, (i) traditional industrial protocols, e.g., Modbus, are retrofitted with TLS support, and (ii) modern protocols, e.g., MQTT, are directly designed to use TLS. To understand whether these changes indeed lead to secure Industrial Internet of Things deployments, i.e., using TLS-based protocols, which are configured according to security best practices, we perform an Internet-wide security assessment of ten industrial protocols covering the complete IPv4 address space.   Our results show that both, retrofitted existing protocols and newly developed secure alternatives, are barely noticeable in the wild. While we find that new protocols have a higher TLS adoption rate than traditional protocols (7.2 % vs. 0.4 %), the overall adoption of TLS is comparably low (6.5 % of hosts). Thus, most industrial deployments (934,736 hosts) are insecurely connected to the Internet. Furthermore, we identify that 42 % of hosts with TLS support (26,665 hosts) show security deficits, e.g., missing access control. Finally, we show that support in configuring systems securely, e.g., via configuration templates, is promising to strengthen security.","tags":["industrial communication","network security","security configuration"],"title":"Missed Opportunities: Measuring the Untapped TLS Support in the Industrial Internet of Things","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Pennekamp","Erik Buchholz","Markus Dahlmanns","Ike Kunze","Stefan Braun","Eric Wagner","Matthias Brockmann","Klaus Wehrle","Martin Henze"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640078165,"objectID":"ee28f15b87c91fb583d1d66a7670552c","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2021-pennekamp-laser/","publishdate":"2021-12-21T09:14:55.892457Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-pennekamp-laser/","section":"publication","summary":"Following the recent Internet of Things-induced trends on digitization in general, industrial applications will further evolve as well. With a focus on the domains of manufacturing and production, the Internet of Production pursues the vision of a digitized, globally interconnected, yet secure environment by establishing a distributed knowledge base. Background. As part of our collaborative research of advancing the scope of industrial applications through cybersecurity and privacy, we identified a set of common challenges and pitfalls that surface in such applied interdisciplinary collaborations. Aim. Our goal with this paper is to support researchers in the emerging field of cybersecurity in industrial settings by formalizing our experiences as reference for other research efforts, in industry and academia alike. Method. Based on our experience, we derived a process cycle of performing such interdisciplinary research, from the initial idea to the eventual dissemination and paper writing. This presented methodology strives to successfully bootstrap further research and to encourage further work in this emerging area. Results. Apart from our newly proposed process cycle, we report on our experiences and conduct a case study applying this methodology, raising awareness for challenges in cybersecurity research for industrial applications. We further detail the interplay between our process cycle and the data lifecycle in applied research data management. Finally, we augment our discussion with an industrial as well as an academic view on this research area and highlight that both areas still have to overcome significant challenges to sustainably and securely advance industrial applications. Conclusions. With our proposed process cycle for interdisciplinary research in the intersection of cybersecurity and industrial application, we provide a foundation for further research. We look forward to promising research initiatives, projects, and directions that emerge based on our methodological work.","tags":null,"title":"Collaboration is not Evil: A Systematic Look at Security Research for Industrial Use","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Pennekamp","Frederik Fuhrmann","Markus Dahlmanns","Timo Heutmann","Alexander Kreppein","Dennis Grunert","Christoph Lange","Robert H.

Today, despite reservation, sensitive information must be shared upfront between buyers and sellers. However, without a trust relation, this situation is precarious for the involved companies as they fear for their competitiveness following information leaks or breaches of their privacy. To address this issue, the concepts of confidential computing and cloud computing come to mind as they promise to offer scalable approaches that preserve the privacy of participating companies. In particular, designs building on confidential computing can help to technically enforce privacy. Moreover, cloud computing constitutes an elegant design choice to scale these novel protocols to industry needs while limiting the setup and management overhead for practitioners. Thus, novel approaches in this area can advance the status quo of bootstrapping new relationships as they provide privacy-preserving alternatives that are suitable for immediate deployment.","tags":["bootstrapping procurement","business relationships","secure industrial collaboration","privacy","Internet of Production"],"title":"Confidential Computing-Induced Privacy Benefits for the Bootstrapping of New Business Relationships","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619637000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635711019,"objectID":"dc05447401a7bfe7fcc813e7052f0d09","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/transparent-end-to-end-security-for-publish/subscribe-communication-in-cyber-physical-systems/","publishdate":"2020-11-09T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/transparent-end-to-end-security-for-publish/subscribe-communication-in-cyber-physical-systems/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Transparent End-to-End Security for Publish/Subscribe Communication in Cyber-Physical Systems","type":"event"},{"authors":["Markus Dahlmanns","Jan Pennekamp","Ina Berenice Fink","Bernd Schoolmann","Klaus Wehrle","Martin Henze"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638095062,"objectID":"092469930aa08c6ead3064c9fde12958","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2021-dahlmanns-entrust/","publishdate":"2021-11-28T10:17:24.253815Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-dahlmanns-entrust/","section":"publication","summary":"The ongoing digitization of industrial manufacturing leads to a decisive change in industrial communication paradigms. Moving from traditional one-to-one to many-to-many communication, publish/subscribe systems promise a more dynamic and efficient exchange of data. However, the resulting significantly more complex communication relationships render traditional end-to-end security futile for sufficiently protecting the sensitive and safety-critical data transmitted in industrial systems. Most notably, the central message brokers inherent in publish/subscribe systems introduce a designated weak spot for security as they can access all communication messages. To address this issue, we propose ENTRUST, a novel solution for key server-based end-to-end security in publish/subscribe systems. ENTRUST transparently realizes confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for publish/subscribe systems without any modification of the underlying protocol. We exemplarily implement ENTRUST on top of MQTT, the de-facto standard for machine-to-machine communication, showing that ENTRUST can integrate seamlessly into existing publish/subscribe systems.","tags":["cyber-physical system security","publish-subscribe security","end-to-end security"],"title":"Transparent End-to-End Security for Publish/Subscribe Communication in Cyber-Physical Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1616756100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635711019,"objectID":"8203381a36b28d012dbca3ba5d446ad6","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/easing-the-conscience-with-opc-ua-an-internet-wide-study-on-insecure-deployments/","publishdate":"2020-11-09T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/easing-the-conscience-with-opc-ua-an-internet-wide-study-on-insecure-deployments/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Easing the Conscience with OPC UA: An Internet-Wide Study on Insecure Deployments","type":"event"},{"authors":["admin","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Therefore, companies hesitate to offer their production data, e.g., process parameters that would allow other companies to establish new production lines faster, against a quid pro quo. Nevertheless, the expected benefits of industrial collaboration, data exchanges, and the utilization of external knowledge are significant. In this paper, we introduce our Bloom filter-based Parameter Exchange (BPE), which enables companies to exchange process parameters privacy-preservingly. We demonstrate the applicability of our platform based on two distinct real-world use cases: injection molding and machine tools. We show that BPE is both scalable and deployable for different needs to foster industrial collaborations. Thereby, we reward data-providing companies with payments while preserving their valuable data and reducing the risks of data leakage.","tags":["secure industrial collaboration","Bloom filter","oblivious transfer","Internet of Production"],"title":"Privacy-Preserving Production Process Parameter Exchange","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604647800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635711019,"objectID":"dacce908e65e236a53b7b5c218197bb3","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/easing-the-conscience-with-opc-ua-an-internet-wide-study-on-insecure-deployments/","publishdate":"2020-11-09T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/easing-the-conscience-with-opc-ua-an-internet-wide-study-on-insecure-deployments/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Easing the Conscience with OPC UA: An Internet-Wide Study on Insecure Deployments","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603830600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635711019,"objectID":"b553f29395e55ee9d5c8aa62cc1b9ae4","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/easing-the-conscience-with-opc-ua-an-internet-wide-study-on-insecure-deployments/","publishdate":"2020-11-09T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/easing-the-conscience-with-opc-ua-an-internet-wide-study-on-insecure-deployments/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Easing the Conscience with OPC UA: An Internet-Wide Study on Insecure Deployments","type":"event"},{"authors":["Markus Dahlmanns","Johannes Lohmöller","Ina Berenice Fink","Jan Pennekamp","Klaus Wehrle","Martin Henze"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638095062,"objectID":"10d31fe3b31af39411545aa0d54ac9af","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2020-dahlmanns-imc-opcua/","publishdate":"2021-11-28T10:17:24.948767Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-dahlmanns-imc-opcua/","section":"publication","summary":"Due to increasing digitalization, formerly isolated industrial networks, e.g., for factory and process automation, move closer and closer to the Internet, mandating secure communication. However, securely setting up OPC UA, the prime candidate for secure industrial communication, is challenging due to a large variety of insecure options. To study whether Internet-facing OPC UA appliances are configured securely, we actively scan the IPv4 address space for publicly reachable OPC UA systems and assess the security of their configurations. We observe problematic security configurations such as missing access control (on 24% of hosts), disabled security functionality (24%), or use of deprecated cryptographic primitives (25%) on in total 92% of the reachable deployments. Furthermore, we discover several hundred devices in multiple autonomous systems sharing the same security certificate, opening the door for impersonation attacks.

In such environments, attackers can derive sensitive private information of IoT device owners, e.g., daily routines or secret supply chain procedures, when sniffing on IoT communication and linking IoT devices and owner. Furthermore, untrusted networks do not provide IoT devices with any protection against attacks from the Internet. Anonymous communication using onion routing provides a well-proven mechanism to keep the relationship between communication partners secret and (optionally) protect against network attacks. However, the application of onion routing is challenged by protocol incompatibilities and demanding cryptographic processing on constrained IoT devices, rendering its use infeasible. To close this gap, we tailor onion routing to the IoT by bridging protocol incompatibilities and offloading expensive cryptographic processing to a router or web server of the IoT device owner. Thus, we realize resource-conserving access control and end-to-end security for IoT devices. To prove applicability, we deploy onion routing for the IoT within the well-established Tor network enabling IoT devices to leverage its resources to achieve the same grade of anonymity as readily available to traditional devices.","tags":null,"title":"Tailoring Onion Routing to the Internet of Things: Security and Privacy in Untrusted Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1568886300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635711019,"objectID":"6e8fc9b248f7b010f82d88f9de15c124","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/regaining-insight-and-control-on-smgw-based-secure-communication-in-smart-grids/","publishdate":"2020-11-09T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/regaining-insight-and-control-on-smgw-based-secure-communication-in-smart-grids/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Regaining Insight and Control on SMGW-based Secure Communication in Smart Grids","type":"event"},{"authors":["Jens Hiller","Karsten Komanns","Markus Dahlmanns","Klaus Wehrle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638095062,"objectID":"1322df30ee4b2a445e03e76dd127ce13","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2019-hiller-aeit-regaining/","publishdate":"2021-11-28T10:17:26.07893Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-hiller-aeit-regaining/","section":"publication","summary":"Smart Grids require extensive communication to enable safe and stable energy supply in the age of decentralized and dynamic energy production and consumption. To protect the communication in this critical infrastructure, public authorities mandate smart meter gateways (SMGWs) to intercept all inbound and outbound communication of premises such as a factory or smart home, and forward the communication data on secure channels established by the SMGW itself to be in control of the communication security. However, using the SMGW as proxy, local devices can neither review the security of these remote connections established by the SMGW nor enforce higher security guarantees than established by the all in one configuration of the SMGW which does not allow for use case-specific security settings. We present mechanisms that enable local devices to regain this insight and control over the full connection, i.e., up to the final receiver, while retaining the SMGW's ability to ensure a suitable security level. Our evaluation shows modest computation and transmission overheads for this increased security in the critical smart grid infrastructure.","tags":null,"title":"Regaining Insight and Control on SMGW-based Secure Communication in Smart Grids","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  **Two**  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
