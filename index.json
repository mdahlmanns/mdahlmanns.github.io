Therefore, companies hesitate to offer their production data, e.g., process parameters that would allow other companies to establish new production lines faster, against a quid pro quo. Nevertheless, the expected benefits of industrial collaboration, data exchanges, and the utilization of external knowledge are significant. In this paper, we introduce our Bloom filter-based Parameter Exchange (BPE), which enables companies to exchange process parameters privacy-preservingly. We demonstrate the applicability of our platform based on two distinct real-world use cases: injection molding and machine tools. We show that BPE is both scalable and deployable for different needs to foster industrial collaborations. Thereby, we reward data-providing companies with payments while preserving their valuable data and reducing the risks of data leakage.","tags":["secure industrial collaboration; Bloom filter; oblivious transfer; Internet of Production"],"title":"Privacy-Preserving Production Process Parameter Exchange","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604647800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606170357,"objectID":"f52ba5cde4f72d7cef3fbd87287dc3ed","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/2020-dahlmanns-maprg-opcua/","publishdate":"2020-11-09T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-dahlmanns-maprg-opcua/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Easing the Conscience with OPC UA: An Internet-Wide Study on Insecure Deployments","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603830600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606170357,"objectID":"deebb09f6dbe570a88aaa026665a16c7","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/2020-dahlmanns-imc-opcua/","publishdate":"2020-11-09T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-dahlmanns-imc-opcua/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Easing the Conscience with OPC UA: An Internet-Wide Study on Insecure Deployments","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Markus Dahlmanns","Johannes Lohmöller","Ina Berenice Fink","Jan Pennekamp","Klaus Wehrle","Martin Henze"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602509501,"objectID":"10d31fe3b31af39411545aa0d54ac9af","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2020-dahlmanns-imc-opcua/","publishdate":"2020-10-12T13:30:02.768896Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-dahlmanns-imc-opcua/","section":"publication","summary":"Due to increasing digitalization, formerly isolated industrial networks, e.g., for factory and process automation, move closer and closer to the Internet, mandating secure communication. However, securely setting up OPC UA, the prime candidate for secure industrial communication, is challenging due to a large variety of insecure options. To study whether Internet-facing OPC UA appliances are configured securely, we actively scan the IPv4 address space for publicly reachable OPC UA systems and assess the security of their configurations. We observe problematic security configurations such as missing access control (on 24% of hosts), disabled security functionality (24%), or use of deprecated cryptographic primitives (25%) on in total 92% of the reachable deployments. Furthermore, we discover several hundred devices in multiple autonomous systems sharing the same security certificate, opening the door for impersonation attacks. Overall, in this paper, we highlight commonly found security misconfigurations and underline the importance of appropriate configuration for security-featuring protocols.","tags":["industrial communication; network security; security configuration"],"title":"Easing the Conscience with OPC UA: An Internet-Wide Study on Insecure Deployments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585833000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606170357,"objectID":"b507a41c14077b5b36c56443f980c1c3","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/2020-roepert-itsec-opcua/","publishdate":"2020-11-09T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-roepert-itsec-opcua/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Assessing the Security of OPC UA Deployments","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Linus Roepert","Markus Dahlmanns","Ina Berenice Fink","Jan Pennekamp","Martin Henze"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602509501,"objectID":"6829a352d617747d22dc67c738a4f093","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2020-roepert-opcua/","publishdate":"2020-10-12T13:30:02.817123Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-roepert-opcua/","section":"publication","summary":"To address the increasing security demands of industrial deployments, OPC UA is one of the first industrial protocols explicitly designed with security in mind. However, deploying it securely requires a thorough configuration of a wide range of options. Thus, assessing the security of OPC UA deployments and their configuration is necessary to ensure secure operation, most importantly confidentiality and integrity of industrial processes. In this work, we present extensions to the popular Metasploit Framework to ease network-based security assessments of OPC UA deployments. To this end, we discuss methods to discover OPC UA servers, test their authentication, obtain their configuration, and check for vulnerabilities.

While such visions introduce opportunities for the involved parties, the associated risks must be considered as well. In particular, security aspects are crucial challenges and remain unsolved. So far, single stakeholders only had to consider their local view on security. However, for a global lab, we identify several fundamental research challenges in (dynamic) scenarios with multiple stakeholders: While information security mandates that models must be adapted wrt. confidentiality to address these new influences on business secrets, from a network perspective, the drastically increasing amount of possible attack vectors challenges today's approaches.

However, this behavior poses a risk for the privacy of clients since these services are able to generate profiles containing very sensitive information, e.g., vulnerability information or collaboration partners. Hence, a rising need for protocols that enable clients to obtain knowledge without revealing their requests exists. To address this issue, we propose a protocol that enables clients (i) to query large cloud-based knowledge systems in a privacy-preserving manner using Private Set Intersection and (ii) to subsequently obtain individual knowledge items without leaking the client\u0026rsquo;s requests via few Oblivious Transfers. With our preliminary design, we allow clients to save a significant amount of time in comparison to performing Oblivious Transfers only.","tags":["private query protocol; knowledge system; remote knowledge; private set intersection; oblivious  transfer"],"title":"Privacy-Preserving Remote Knowledge System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jens Hiller","Jan Pennekamp","Markus Dahlmanns","Martin Henze","Andriy Panchenko","Klaus Wehrle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602509501,"objectID":"a63d35a442c475382ba5ee4e0700a24b","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2019-hiller-icnp-tailoring-or/","publishdate":"2020-10-12T13:30:02.891107Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-hiller-icnp-tailoring-or/","section":"publication","summary":"An increasing number of IoT scenarios involve mobile, resource-constrained IoT devices that rely on untrusted networks for Internet connectivity. In such environments, attackers can derive sensitive private information of IoT device owners, e.g., daily routines or secret supply chain procedures, when sniffing on IoT communication and linking IoT devices and owner. Furthermore, untrusted networks do not provide IoT devices with any protection against attacks from the Internet. Anonymous communication using onion routing provides a well-proven mechanism to keep the relationship between communication partners secret and (optionally) protect against network attacks. However, the application of onion routing is challenged by protocol incompatibilities and demanding cryptographic processing on constrained IoT devices, rendering its use infeasible. To close this gap, we tailor onion routing to the IoT by bridging protocol incompatibilities and offloading expensive cryptographic processing to a router or web server of the IoT device owner. Thus, we realize resource-conserving access control and end-to-end security for IoT devices. To prove applicability, we deploy onion routing for the IoT within the well-established Tor network enabling IoT devices to leverage its resources to achieve the same grade of anonymity as readily available to traditional devices.","tags":null,"title":"Tailoring Onion Routing to the Internet of Things: Security and Privacy in Untrusted Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1568886300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606170357,"objectID":"2b00adf7ae87ec3e37e66093e9ef2777","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/talk/2019-hiller-aeit-regaining/","publishdate":"2020-11-09T17:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-hiller-aeit-regaining/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Regaining Insight and Control on SMGW-based Secure Communication in Smart Grids","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jens Hiller","Karsten Komanns","Markus Dahlmanns","Klaus Wehrle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602509501,"objectID":"1322df30ee4b2a445e03e76dd127ce13","permalink":"https://mdahlmanns.de/publication/2019-hiller-aeit-regaining/","publishdate":"2020-10-12T13:30:02.971674Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-hiller-aeit-regaining/","section":"publication","summary":"Smart Grids require extensive communication to enable safe and stable energy supply in the age of decentralized and dynamic energy production and consumption. To protect the communication in this critical infrastructure, public authorities mandate smart meter gateways (SMGWs) to intercept all inbound and outbound communication of premises such as a factory or smart home, and forward the communication data on secure channels established by the SMGW itself to be in control of the communication security. However, using the SMGW as proxy, local devices can neither review the security of these remote connections established by the SMGW nor enforce higher security guarantees than established by the all in one configuration of the SMGW which does not allow for use case-specific security settings. We present mechanisms that enable local devices to regain this insight and control over the full connection, i.e., up to the final receiver, while retaining the SMGW's ability to ensure a suitable security level. Our evaluation shows modest computation and transmission overheads for this increased security in the critical smart grid infrastructure.","tags":null,"title":"Regaining Insight and Control on SMGW-based Secure Communication in Smart Grids","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This page is powered by the Wowchemy for Hugo.
